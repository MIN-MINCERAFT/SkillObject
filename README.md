# about
I was hired as a developer of the minecraft RPG server that I was developing. At that time, skill code was interesting how to create skills with entities, but it seemed to depend too much on entities. So I made an `object` that could be replaced, and I made an `Entity` that could put a model on it.

I made this with part of I wrote source.
